# Code Refinement

Please refine the code in the provided path. These are the things we want to replace and upgrade:

- Replace single letter and ambigious variable names with full meaningful names
- Refactor nested if loops and complex logic into smaller simpler indiviual components. 
- Use match statements and `:=` and `or` operators to simplify logic
- Use comprehenisions to simplify logic
- Break large scripts, functions or classes up into smaller components seperating concerns of their functions or methods
- Ensure proper typing across the script using the modern typing standards:
    - `|` instead of `Union[]`, 
    - `| None = None` instead of  `Optional`
    - `dict[]` instead of `Dict[]`
    - `list[]` insetad of `List[]`
